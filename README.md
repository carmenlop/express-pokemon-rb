# Pokemon Team Builder
An application where a user can create a profile and build a team with their battle ready pokemon, once their team is built the user is able to look at their individual pokemonâ€™s stats and add/delete members to their pokemon team. There is a feature where the user can get a random Pokemon to display and they decide if they want to add the Pokemon to their team or skip to the next random Pokemon. Users can also add/edit notes for each Pokemon.
